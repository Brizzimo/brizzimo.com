		<h1>
			Brizzimo is a name that I came up with for my “business” as a way to share my 
			ideas/inventions and maybe one day have real customers. <br><br>

			Although my degree is in mechanical engineering, I have experience in many different 
			disciplines including electronics, robotics, sewing, coding, construction, testing, and 
			just about every type of manufacturing process out there allowing me to create and design 
			products for any need. <br><br>

			Everything on this website which I also designed has been a project undertaken during my 
			free time either for my own fun or for those who request it. Anything from replacement dishwasher 
			clips to automated secret boxes. The two main design principles for everything designed are 
			simplicity and functionality.  <br><br>

			Another very important aspect is sustainability, leading to things being made of sustainable 
			materials or things that would otherwise be scrapped. I am basically the master of using that 
			scrap piece of wood you keep around ~just in case~. <br><br>

			By clicking on the solutions tag or by visiting the Brizzimo Instagram account linked at the 
			bottom of the page, you will be able to get an idea for the things that I can create.
